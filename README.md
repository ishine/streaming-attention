Streaming-attention
====
* Provide [codes](https://github.com/HaoranMiao/streaming-attention/blob/master/attentions.py) of streaming attention mechanisms for end-to-end automatic speech recognition using Pytorch

* Provide [algorithms](https://github.com/HaoranMiao/streaming-attention/blob/master/algorithm.pdf) of the implementation of these streaming attention mechanisms for better understading

* Compatible to [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet)

Stable Monotonic Chunkwise Attention (sMoChA)
----

sMoChA is described in "Online Hybrid CTC/Attention Architecture for End-to-End Speech Recognition" by H Miao, G Gao, P Zhang, T Li, Y Yan, in Proceedings of Interspeech 2019.

Monotonic Truncated Attention (MTA)
----

MTA is described in an unpublished submitted journal.
